  the modules needed in the language.

      documenting purposes. E.g. #(sexp comment), #sexp_comment

- [X] Only one logical false, anything else is considered true -
      () = fnord = '() = 'fnord

- [X] Quote - returns the argument untouched. Extended syntax - '.
- [X] Quasiquote - returns the argument with embedded
      expressions. Extended syntax - `.
- [X] Embed - embeds an expression in quasiquote and strings,
      evaluates strings, binds variables in pattern matching.
      Extended syntax - $.
