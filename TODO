#+SEQ_TODO: THINK TODO DONE

* TODO THINGS CONCERNING THIS FILE [SIC]:
! Restructure "THINNGS TO IMPLEMENT IN THE LANGUAGE" to map neatly to
the modules needed in the language.
* TODO THINGS TO IMPLEMENT IN THE LANGUAGE:
** DONE Lexical:
*** DONE Comments:
- [X] Line comments starting with "##" or "# ". E.g. # line comment\n
- [X] Expression comments - analyzed syntacticly, used for debugging and
      documenting purposes. E.g. #(sexp comment), #sexp_comment
** TODO Language quirks:
*** DONE Booleans:
- [X] Only one logical false, anything else is considered true -
      () = fnord = '() = 'fnord
*** DONE Quoting & embedding:
- [X] Quote - returns the argument untouched. Extended syntax - '.
- [X] Quasiquote - returns the argument with embedded
      expressions. Extended syntax - `.
- [X] Embed - embeds an expression in quasiquote and strings,
      evaluates strings, binds variables in pattern matching.
      Extended syntax - $.
*** THINK Pattern matching:
- [ ] (matches? pattern arg)
- [ ] Binds embedded/backtracked symbols from pattern to the actual objects,
      returns a Scope with the symbols defined in it.
*** THINK Backtracking:
- [ ] Triggered by backtrack expression. Extended syntax - ?.
*** THINK Error handling:
- [ ] ? error/catch functions.
** TODO Atomic types:
*** DONE Numbers:
- [X] Evaluate to themselves.
*** DONE Symbols:
- [X] Evaluate to their bound expression.
*** TODO Strings:                                                     :THINK:
- [X] Immutable
- [X] Symbol:
    + [X] Evaluate to themselves unless forced to eval by embed
          expression.
    + [X] WYSIWYG meaning they can contain whitespaces and syntax tokens.
- [ ] Collection:
    + [ ] ? Consist of one letter symbols - characters.
    + [ ] ? Consist of numerical representations of the characters.
    + [ ] ? Consist of one letter strings.
- [ ] ? Special regex literal - /some regex/
- [ ] ! Recognise escape sequences. E.g. "\n" etc
- [ ] Used for documentation.
- [ ] ! Rocagnise expression expansion "$(* 2 2) != 2" -> "4 != 2"
** TODO Callable types:
*** TODO Functions:                                                   :THINK:
- [X] First-class objects.
- [ ] Pure functions:
    + [ ] Can call only other pure functions.
    + [ ] ? Receive pure+syntax subset of a Scope.
    + [ ] Parallel higher order functions (like map, reduce etc) for
          pure functions.
- [X] Anonymous function creation - (function (argslist) body)
- [X] Closures.
- [ ] ? Keywords:
    + [ ] ! .lazy - toggles lazy evaluation.
    + [ ] ! .optional - makes an argument optional.
*** TODO Macros:                                                      :THINK:
- [ ] First class objects.
- [X] Evaluated before regular evaluation.
- [X] Create new syntax keywords.
- [X] Easly defined with a clean form - (macro name (argslist) body)
- [ ] ? Keywords:
    + [ ] ! .optional - makes an argument optional.
*** TODO Scopes:
- [X] First-class objects.
- [X] Allow binding symbols to other objects.
- [ ] Allow merging with other Scopes.
- [ ] ! Allow to be imported into other scopes. ? E.g. their outter Scope
      becomes the one they are imported to.
** TODO Collection types:
*** DONE Tuples:
- [X] Immutable
- [X] Call the first Callable object in them with the rest of the
      tuple as the call arguments upon their evaluation.
*** TODO List:                                                        :THINK:
- [ ] ! Evaluate to an anonymous function built from the list.
- [ ] ? Callable with a comparator used to sort the list.
*** TODO Sets:                                                        :THINK:
- [X] Evaluate all the expressions they contain in the source file
      order, returning the last one.
- [ ] ? Callable with a predicate/relation, returns subset satisfying
      the predicate/relation.
- [ ] ? Callable with a comparator used to sort the set.
* TODO THINGS TO IMPLEMENT IN THE LIBRARY:
** THINK ASMKit

      to implement the language.

*** THINK Functions:
# TODO
** THINK Modules:

      collection, or its value if collection is immutable.

- [ ] ? tuple - returns a tuple consisting of the call args.
- [ ] ? set - returns a set consisting of the call args.
