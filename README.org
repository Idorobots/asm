* ASM
This is an another syntactic monstrosity, a language so /hip/ it doesn't even appear on Tiobe's list!

For licensing info see LICENSE file.
For stuff to come see lang/brev.pdf.

* Building
Just type =make= in the root directory of the repo. By default the GDC compiler (https://bitbucket.org/goshawk/gdc/wiki/Home) is used, to use DMD instead, type =make dmd=.
